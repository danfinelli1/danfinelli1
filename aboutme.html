	<p>I am in love with the most beautiful girl in the entire world <br>
	  Her name is Brielle Reddington and she is going to be my wife. <br>
		She waits for me in Jersey as I build a career and a future for<br>
	  us. I love you so much Brielle. I'm so sad I don't get to see  <br>
	  my bumblebee for my birthday, but I am counting the moments    <br>
	  until I see you again.    </p>
